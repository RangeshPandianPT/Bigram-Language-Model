# Project Roadmap: Next Level LLM

Your current implementation is a solid "Vanilla GPT" (similar to GPT-2). To take this project to the next level (modern Open LLaMA style), we can improve three key areas: **Architecture**, **Engineering**, and **Inference**.

## Level 1: Architectural Modernization ("Llama-fication") ✅ COMPLETED

Modern LLMs have moved away from the original GPT-2 architecture in several ways to improve stability and performance.

### 1. RMSNorm (Root Mean Square Normalization) ✅
**Why:** Replaces LayerNorm. It's simpler, faster, and more numerically stable. Used in Llama, Gopher, Chinchilla.
**Status:** ✅ Implemented in `model.py`

### 2. Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) ✅
**Why:** Replaces absolute learned positional embeddings. RoPE encodes relative positions better, allowing the model to generalize to sequence lengths longer than it was trained on.
**Status:** ✅ Implemented with precomputed frequencies

### 3. SwiGLU Activation ✅
**Why:** Replaces ReLU or GeLU. It consistently yields better performance for the same compute budget.
**Status:** ✅ Implemented in `FeedForward` module

### 4. Grouped Query Attention (GQA) ✅
**Why:** Reduces memory bandwidth usage during inference. It's a middle ground between Multi-Head (MHA) and Multi-Query (MQA).
**Status:** ✅ Activated with `n_kv_head=2` — 4 query heads share 2 KV heads (50% KV memory reduction). Verified by `test_gqa.py`.

## Level 2: Scalable Engineering ✅ COMPLETED

Your current `bigram.py` does everything in one file. Real-world projects need modularity and efficiency.

### 1. Modularity & Refactoring ✅
**Status:** ✅ Separated into `model.py`, `train.py`, `config.py`, `generate.py`

### 2. Efficient Data Loading (`numpy.memmap`) ✅
**Status:** ✅ Pre-tokenized dataset into binary files with BPE tokenization

### 3. Mixed Precision Training ✅
**Status:** ✅ Integrated `torch.amp` and `GradScaler` for 2-3x faster training

---

## Level 3: Inference Optimization ✅ COMPLETED

Making the model generate text faster and smarter.

### 1. KV Optimization (Key-Value Cache) ✅
**Status:** ✅ Implemented KV cache for O(N) generation instead of O(N²)

### 2. Sampling Strategies ✅
**Status:** ✅ Implemented Temperature, Top-k, Top-p (Nucleus), and Repetition Penalty

---

## Level 4: Training Improvements ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Learning Rate Scheduling ✅
**Status:** ✅ Cosine decay with linear warmup

### 2. Gradient Clipping ✅
**Status:** ✅ Prevents gradient explosions

### 3. Weight Decay ✅
**Status:** ✅ Better generalization with AdamW

### 4. Model Checkpointing ✅
**Status:** ✅ Saves best model based on validation loss

### 5. Perplexity Tracking ✅
**Status:** ✅ Tracks both loss and perplexity metrics

## 🚀 Next Steps: Scaling Up

### 1. Train Larger Model ✅
- Scaled to: `n_layer=8`, `n_embd=256`, `n_head=8`, `n_kv_head=4`, `block_size=128`
- Training config: `max_iters=5000`, `batch_size=32`, `warmup_iters=200`

### 2. Implement GQA (Grouped Query Attention) ✅
- Activated with `n_kv_head=4` (50% KV memory reduction)
- Verified by `test_gqa.py`

### 3. Advanced Features
- ✅ Flash Attention implementation using PyTorch SDPA (faster memory-efficient attention computation)
- Model parallelism for multi-GPU training
- Quantization for deployment
